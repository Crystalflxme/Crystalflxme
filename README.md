# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Paul.
Roblox Developer â€” Programmer â€” Student

### ðŸ”Ž About Me
I've been messing around on Roblox for almost 7 years now. I have experince with Lua, JavaScript, Java, and a little bit of other languages. At the moment, I'm trying to push new amazing projects on Roblox and learn some new coding languages. In terms of game development, I'm mostly into backend and security development, but I've had a lot of experince with frontend too.

I try to open-source any projects that I can, but a lot of my systems I keep proprietary for studios that I work in. Any open-source work that I have should be available here on GitHub.

### ðŸ—‚ Experience & Projects
- **Lead Developer @ [HexTech](https://www.roblox.com/groups/4361197)** <br>
  This is my main studio that I spend most of my time and would be where the majority of my Roblox games are. Here, HexTech's games have accumulated 160K+ plays/visits.
  
- **That Elevator Game ([Roblox Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/3953223571))** <br>
  Originally created in late 2019, this comedy based random elevator simulator has grown a lot. Not my favorite project to work on, but polishing this game to the stage it's at today was quite fun.
