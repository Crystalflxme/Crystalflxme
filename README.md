## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm Paul, and I've been working on Roblox over 10 years. At the moment, I'm pushing new and amazing projects while attending university.

I try to open-source any projects that I can, but a lot of my work is proprietary for organizations that I work in. My most notable work, social links, and blog can be found on my website below. Any open-source projects that I have should be available here or under related organizations on GitHub.
