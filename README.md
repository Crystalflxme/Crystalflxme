# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Paul.
Roblox Developer â€” Programmer â€” Student

### ðŸ”Ž About Me
I've been messing around on Roblox about 7 years now and that's been where I've been spending a lot of my time recently. At the moment, I'm trying to push new amazing projects on Roblox.

I try to open-source any projects that I can, but a lot of my systems I keep proprietary for studios that I work in. Any open-source work that I have should be available here on GitHub.

### ðŸ—‚ Experience & Open-Source Projects
- **Lead Developer @ [HexTech](https://www.roblox.com/groups/4361197)** <br>
  This is my main studio that I spend most of my time and would be where the majority of my Roblox games are. HexTech's games have accumulated 193K+ plays/visits.
  
- **That Elevator Game ([Roblox Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/3953223571))** <br>
  In That Elevator Game you get in a random elevator then visit even more random floors. With lots of badges and quests to complete, traverse through minigames, obbies, and more in your quest to level up and earn coins for gears, flairs, and particles.

- **ChatPlus ([Roblox System](https://github.com/Crystalflxme/ChatPlus))** <br>
  ChatPlus is a system to allow easy management of the default Roblox chat system. As of July 19th 2021, Roblox Developer Forum users rated the system a 7.78/10 and about 71% said they would use ChatPlus in their own game.

- **Cooldown ([Roblox Module](https://github.com/Crystalflxme/Cooldown))** <br>
  Cooldown is a small lightweight performant method of managing cooldowns.
