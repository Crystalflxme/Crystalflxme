# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Paul.
Roblox Developer â€” Programmer â€” Student

### ðŸ”Ž About Me
I've been messing around on Roblox about 9 years. At the moment, I'm pushing new amazing projects on Roblox.

I try to open-source any projects that I can, but a lot of my systems I keep proprietary for studios that I work in. For a list of my experience, see my Roblox Talent Hub profile in the socials below. Any open-source work that I have should be available here on GitHub.
