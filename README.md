Roblox Developer — Programmer — Student

### 🔎 About Me
I've been messing around on Roblox about 7 years now and that's been where I've been spending a lot of my time recently. At the moment, I'm trying to push new amazing projects on Roblox.

I try to open-source any projects that I can, but a lot of my systems I keep proprietary for studios that I work in. For a list of my jobs, see my Roblox Talent Hub profile in the socials below. Any open-source work that I have should be available here on GitHub.

### 🗂 Main Open-Source Projects
- **ChatPlus ([Roblox System](https://github.com/Crystalflxme/ChatPlus))** <br>
  ChatPlus is a system to allow easy management of the default Roblox chat system. As of December 31st 2021, Roblox Developer Forum users rated the system a 7.78/10 and about 71% said they would use ChatPlus in their own game.

- **Hexwork ([Roblox Module Collection](https://github.com/Crystalflxme/Hexwork))** <br>
  A collection of modules that I often use in my own games to speed up and aid development.
